"Learned about how java utilizes atleast a few primitives since everything being a class would be unnecessary for simple arithmitic
	the raw data is
		Byte
		short
		int
		long
		float
		double
		char
		Boolean

byte is small and its range is         -128 to 127
short is bigger and the range is       -32768 to 32767
int is the DEFAULT, and range is       -2.1 billion to 2.1 billion
long is the biggest, and its range is  -9.2x10^18 to 9.2x10^18

double is the default for decimal numbers
float has less decimal places, but can also be used for decimal numbers
float is faster
double is standard, slower, and more precise
when overflow happes, the massive number goes from max value to the max negative value

   -----------------
  /                   
 v

|                    | 
----------------------
min       0         max

so a max int gets wrapped back around to the max negative number

char must be defined with '' not "" since "" is for strings
boolean is only defined as true or false

if you want to define a long integer you have to be careful since everything is default an int
and int values cannot be massive while long values can
so the int number for a long needs to have an L and the end of the value
long d = 2147483648L;"
