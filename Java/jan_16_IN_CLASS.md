fork means to take a repo off of github and copy it not only onto your github repos but you can also clone the ssh to your computer to work off the cloned repo and push changes you make to the cloned repo on your account 

If you want to clone a repo to change the scope or direction of your project, you probably only want the latest, main branch. other wise for this class uncheck the box to copy all branches, not just the main branch

difference between System.out.print and System.out.println is that the first outputs to the same line while println prints out to a new line

i++ is post increment, so it executes what ever its in first, then adds 1 to the value of i
++i is pre increment, so it executes after adding 1 to the value of i

in java, you first define the type of array, before putting the brackets for the array
so String[] "array name"  without the quotes makes a array with Strings (words/letters) with the name array name
String[] arrayname

need to google how for loops and while loops work
need to google how enhanced for loops work

git checkout "branch name" changes the branch 
have to save, commit, and push changes before working on a new branch, or going to the main branch for example.
